This repository contains a bug report and solution for a type mismatch error encountered while converting a string to a number in ActionScript 3.  The bug occurs when attempting to convert a string containing non-numeric characters using the `int()` function. The solution demonstrates how to handle such cases using error handling and input validation to prevent the error.
